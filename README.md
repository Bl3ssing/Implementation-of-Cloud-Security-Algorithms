# Implementation-of-Cloud-Security-Algorithms
The objective of this project is to make a tool implementing cloud security algorithms (DES, AES, and Blowfish) for file encryption and decryption using database connectivity and uploading the file dynamically to the Cloud (Amazon AWS S3). The encrypted file is sent to an Amazon S3 Bucket with a time stamp ensuring the privacy of data.
